# Raspberry Pi Setup

Just my personal notes on how to set up a Raspberry Pi from scratch.

Note that many of the instructions here could apply to any Linux machine,
they aren't exclusive to the Raspberry Pi.

By the end, you will have a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Jessie Lite (no GUI),
which you can administer via SSH, so you can leave it plugged in to power somewhere
without needing anything else to be plugged in.
